Task 1
In order to run the code please follow the following steps: 
1. Load the project program into a java IDE such as eclipse
2. Click on Task1 package and click the run button on AddressTranslation.java
3. Once the program is running, the program will prompt you to enter a page size, then a virtual address 
4. The corresponding page number and offset will then be displayed to the console

Task 2
In order to run the code please follow the following steps: 
1. Load the project program into a java IDE such as eclipse
2. Click on Task2 package and click the run button on DiskSchedulingRun.java
3. Once the program is running, the program will prompt you to choose among and automatically generate a series of random requests (option 1) or input a txt file (option2). 

Instructions for option 1
- Select random generation by inputting the number one, then hitting enter
- The random requests will then be displayed
Instructions for option 2
- Select the input txt option by inputting the number two, then hitting enter
- There will then be a prompt asking you to enter the txt file (there are two options)
    - 1st Option: Enter the pre-loaded txt file in the src folder ‘src/queue.txt’ then hitting enter
    - 2nd Option: You may also enter your own txt file
	- This may be done by entering the txt file in the src folder
	- The format of the txt file is a number, followed by a number in the next line
		E.g.: 1 (line 1)
		      2 (line 2)
                      3 (line 3)

- The user will be then asked again to enter the location of their txt file 

(Note: the user will be asked twice to enter the txt file location twice)

4. The user will then be presented with the queue that has been entered from the txt file and will then be asked to enter the initial head
Enter the initial head integer, then hit enter

5. The user will be then be prompted with the the option of choosing (1)FCFS, (2) SSTF, (3)SCAN and (4) CSCAN
	-enter the desired algorithm based on its number, then press enter

Note: If SCAN or CSCAN are chosen, the user will be prompted to enter a previous head position
So be sure to enter the previous head position to determine the algorithms direction

6. After, the results of the algorithm will be display how many movements there has been and the amount of direction changes

Task 3
In order to run the code please follow the following steps: 
1. Load the project program into a java IDE such as eclipse
2. Click on Task1 package and click the run button on Cylinder.java
3. Once the program is running, the program will prompt you to enter: 
	-A logical block number (enter number, then press enter)
	-The number of cylinders (enter number, then press enter)
	-The number of tracks  (enter number, then press enter)
	-The number of sectors  (enter number, then press enter)
After, the program will then display the logical block’s location
